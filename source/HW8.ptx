<p>
 Prove there exists no <m>3</m>-connected graph (in other words with <m>k(G)\ge 3</m>) with exactly 7 edges.

<p>
  Let <m>G=T_5</m>, where <m>T_5</m> is the tree in Figure 4.3 (page 88) of your book. 
</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
        <p>
           Draw the graphs <m>G^2</m> and <m>G^3 </m>
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
    Find <m>k(G^2)</m> and <m>\lambda(G^2)</m>, 
  indicating the minimum vertex-cut and edge-cuts. 
        </p>
    </li>
  </ol>

<exercise>
<p>
   On page 121 of your book is described the construction of the Harary graph <m>H_{r,n}</m> when both <m>r</m> and <m>n</m> are odd. This is no 
   longer a regular graph (since no such graph exists when both <m>r</m> and <m>n</m> are odd), but it has <m>n-1</m> vertices of degree <m>r</m> and one vertex 
   of degree <m>r+1</m>. Read the construction in the book and draw the graph <m>H_{5,7}</m>. Then, find its edge-connectivity.

    <p>
        Decide if the graph below is Eulerian. If it is, give an Eulerian circuit by enumerating the edges. Start at the vertex denoted S.
