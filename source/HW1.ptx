          For problem 1.16: This is a proof problem. It needs to be written in Overleaf and printed separately (unless you write the entire homework in Overleaf). Instructions are below.  I will not grade this problem now. I will give you feedback, and then you need to resubmit it for the next hw.

    [Problem A]: First, watch the video at <url href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2A2pGrDG8I/">What is the Pigeonhole Principle? </url>. Then, search the internet for an interesting problem that uses the pigeonhole principle. Write down the problem and its solution, fully explained.

        <p> [Problem B]:  Let <m>S</m> be a finite set of integers and let <m>G</m> be the graph on vertex set <m>S</m> where for any <m>x,y\in S</m>, <m>xy\in E(G)</m> if and only if <m>x+y</m> is odd.
<ol>
<li> Prove that <m>G</m> is a bipartite graph for any such <m>S</m>: indentify the partite sets and explain why they satisfy the definition. </li>
<li> If <m>S=\{1, 2, \dots, 100\}</m>, find the value of <m>|E(G)|</m> (the number of edges of <m>G</m>)? Justify your answer.</li>

  <title> Instructions for Overleaf </title>

  <p> You need to create a (free) account on <url href="https://www.overleaf.com/"> Overleaf </url>. </p>
  <p> You will need to write the solution for  problem 1.16 above in Overleaf, print the resulting pdf file and turn it in with the rest of your homework. The code I am giving you below illustrates the main ideas of how to write math in Overleaf, using LaTeX. I trust that you can find plenty of resources on the internet to figure out anything else you may need. </p>
  <p> To create your file: click on <c>Create new project</c> (give it a name) then <c> Blank project </c>. The blank project will contain a file called <c>main.tex</c>.You can change the name of the file to <c>hw1.tex</c>. 
    Delete the text in the file and paste the following text instead: </p>

\noindent {\bf Problem 1.16 (HW \# 1)} 
Let $P=(u=v_0,v_1, \dots, v_k=v)$, $k\ge 1$, be a $u-v$ geodesic in a connected graph $G$. Prove: 
\[
d(u,v_i)=i \qquad \text{for each integer $i$ with $1\le i\le k$}
\]
