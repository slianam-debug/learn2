  Use the algorithm "Double the tree" for the following Traveling Salesman Problem. You need to show all the steps of the algorithm: 
  <ol>
    <li>
        <p>
        Find a minimum spanning tree (any algorithm you want);     
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
          Double the tree;  
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
         Find an Eulerian circuit for the doubled tree   
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
          Follow the Eulerian circuit, taking shortcuts 
  as necessary to avoid repeating vertices.   
        </p>
    </li>
  </ol>  
  The output should be a Hamiltonian cycle. Give the cycle by enumerating the vertices, and also compute the total weight.

 Suppose certain pairs in a department of six people (<m> A, B, C, D, E, F</m>) must meet privately in a single available conference room. The following is a list of pairs that need to meet: 
<me>
  \{A,B\}, \{A,D\}, \{A,E\}, \{B,C\}, \{B,D\}, \{B,F\}, \{C,E\}, \{D, E\}, \{D,F\}, \{E,F\}  
</me>
If a pair is in this list, e.g. <m> \{A,B\}</m>, then this means that <m> A</m> and <m>B</m> need to meet. 
</p>
    
<p> Is it possible to sequence the two-person conferences so that one of the participants in each conference (except for the last one) also participates in the next conference, but no one participates in three consecutive conferences? 
If so, describe how the sequencing needs to be done (who meets first, who meets next, etc.) 
</p>
<p>
You need to answer this problem using concepts and results of 
graph theory that we talked about, and describe how the given problem can be translated into a problem about a graph, 
and then solve the problem using the graph.

    <p>
    Let <m>G=P_4</m> (the path graph on <m>4</m> vertices). Is the graph <m>G^2</m> Hamiltonian? 
    If the graph is Hamiltonian, you need to describe a Hamiltonian cycle (label the vertices as you wish). If it is not Hamiltonian, explain why. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Repeat problem 3 above with <m>G=P_5</m>.
