[Problem C]: Draw the graphs and .      Instructions for Overleaf  You need to create a (free) account on Overleaf .  You will need to write the solution for problem 1.16 above in Overleaf, print the resulting pdf file and turn it in with the rest of your homework. The code I am giving you below illustrates the main ideas of how to write math in Overleaf, using LaTeX. I trust that you can find plenty of resources on the internet to figure out anything else you may need.  To create your file: click on Create new project (give it a name) then Blank project . The blank project will contain a file called main.tex .You can change the name of the file to hw1.tex . Each time you make a change in the file, click on Recompile to see the .pdf output, that can be downloaded (see Download PDF on the top menu.) Delete the text in the file and paste the following text instead:  \\documentclass{amsart} \\usepackage[margin=1in]{geometry} \\usepackage{amsmath,amssymb} \\usepackage{graphicx} % Required for inserting images \\begin{document} \\begin{center} {\\bf MATH 314 HW\\# 1 Proof problem} \\end{center} \\bigskip \\noindent {\\bf Problem 1.16 (HW \\# 1)} Let $P=(u=v_0,v_1, \\dots, v_k=v)$, $k\\ge 1$, be a $u-v$ geodesic in a connected graph $G$.
